### Local Feline Duo Continues Pattern of Domestic Manipulation

**Original Text:**

I have two cats, Smokey and Snickers, both rescue cats I got back when I lived in North Carolina.

Smokey, my mother got from this terrible pet store that clearly was mistreating their animals and so I came home one weekend and she was just there. She was terrified of us at first and was very quiet and timid, but she's the opposite now. She will incessantly meow when she determines it's time to eat and rub up on you and be affectionate just to lure you into a false sense of security so you will feel compelled to give her a "treaty-treat".

Snickers, I picked out on my 18th birthday because my mother insisted that "Smokey needed a friend" and I tried to give him one of those squeezy-tube treats (called Churus) and he just kept biting at the plastic instead of licking the treat and I knew that I loved him and his one brain cell. Now, he's the opposite of Smokey; very anxious and skittish, but his one-brain cell moments still shine through. More often than not, you will find him sitting ontop of one of the vents in my grandparents house trying to warm himself up during these cold winter months.

These two fluffy disasters are menaces: I've watched Snickers run so fast he can't stop himself he flies straight into a wall, Smokey frequently will block your pathway in the kitchen when you're trying not to burn something just to stare up at you with the most innocent "Oh what, little old me?" look you've ever seen, and both of those furballs will on occasion start beating the ever loving hell out of each other and I have to break them up like some sort of feline intervention specialist.

Recently, Snickers broke into a bag of catnip neither my family or I have any idea how he got his fuzzy little paws on, but we found out because under our dining room table was the brutalized remains of the plastic bag and like 60% of the catnip. I found Snickers soon after and he looked like he was on another realm of existence.
